I was looking for an uwwwwwuifier that supported input from
stdin and from parameters, that doesn't need 500.000 bloated dependencies to work.
So i made this.

## I want to use it
To use Uwwwu<sup>PP</sup> locally, as a CLI, you do have to compile it yourself.
But it is really easy. Compile instructions are below.

You can also use Uwwwu<sup>PP</sup> online, there's an uwuifier website using it, and providing a free-to-use rest api.
Visit [uwu.pm](https://uwu.pm) to quickly try Uwwwu<sup>PP</sup> without having to deal with compiling it.

**[Try online now](https://uwu.pm)**

## Compile instructions
To do so, make sure you have cmake installed.
Clone this repository, and install all dependencies via:
```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then all you have to do is to start the build:
```
$ cmake Src -B build
$ cd build
$ make
```

Lastly, verify that your build works correctly:
```
# Assuming workdir is build/
$ ./Src/Uwwwu Hello, thanks for paying this repository a visit :D
